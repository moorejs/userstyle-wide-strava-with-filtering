# Wide Strava with Filtering

A user style for the Strava dashboard.
It features activities in a grid with non-activity posts filtered and additional activity filtering options.

# How to use it

Any extension that works with user styles should support this script.
I developed and applied it with [Stylish](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylish-custom-themes-for/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe) using the [Orion browser](https://browser.kagi.com).

Eventually, the styles should be made available as a user script (Tampermonkey, Greasemonkey, etc.) and the user styles sites.
